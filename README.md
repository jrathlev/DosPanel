### DosPanel
DosPanel is a graphical user interface for [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) under Windows. 
The user can make all required settings 
needed to start DOS applications in DOSBox without concern the somewhat crude syntax of the 
configuration file. Each DOS application can have its individual settings stored by the program.

**The functions at a glance:**

- Mounting drives for a DOS application:
  - Any directory on the host system as hard drive
  - Any host DVD/CD drive or ISO image as CD drive
- Selection of an application or DOS batch file with optional parameters to be started automatically when opening *DOSBox*
- A list of any DOS commands to be executed before starting the above application (e.g. changing the directory)
- Selection of an icon to be displayed in DosPanel
- Optional selection of a keymapper
- Selection of a manual (e.g. text or PDF) for the DOS application
- Additional comments
- Additional options: full screen and automatic closing of *DOSBox*
- Adjustment of the DOS user memory
- Adjustment of the emulation speed
